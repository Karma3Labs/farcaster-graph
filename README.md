# Extract Graph-based insights from Farcaster
The project is broken into two sub-projects:

1. `pipeline` - python scripts to generate graphs and dataframes that can be used to serve graph-based queries.
2. `serve` - FastAPI server to serve API requests for querying the graph from Farcaster.

__NOTE__ For details on how to deploy an individual sub-project, check out the Readme docs under that sub-project.
